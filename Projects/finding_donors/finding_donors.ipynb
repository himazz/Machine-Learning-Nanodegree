    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "- The three chosen algorithms are:\n",
    "                          1- Decision Trees.\n",
    "                          2- K-Nearest Neighbors. \n",
    "                          3- Random Forest.\n",
    "** 1- Decision Tree **\n",
    "      \n",
    "- MODEL: We can make a model for a vast company that is periodically making interviews with new candidates. the model will be built to classify the cadidadant by they acceptation opportunities, gives some required skill that must meet the accepted one and some data of the applicant and here we go we can make it work very well :D\n",
    "- Decision Trees are easy to explain. It results in a set of rules,It follows the same approach as humans generally follow while making decisions,Interpretation of a complex Decision Tree model can be simplified by its visualizations. Even a naive person can understand logic,The Number of hyper-parameters to be tuned is almost null.\n",
    "- There is a high probability of overfitting in Decision Tree,Generally, it gives low prediction accuracy for a dataset as compared to other machine learning algorithms,Information gain in a decision tree with categorical variables gives a biased response for attributes with greater no. of categories,Calculations can become complex when there are many class labels.\n",
    "- Since we are predicting whether the person is going to donate or not, it is a classification problem, given that data it becomes a very simple common seance judgment, for example the person who is rich the one makes a lot of many say more than 50K is more likely to donate for us most of other feature can be measured the same way, like that: the person who had a high education is more likely to donate us... a so on\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ** refering to \"http://dataaspirant.com/2017/01/30/how-decision-tree-algorithm-works/ \" **.\n",
    "   \n",
    "** 2- K-Nearest Neighbors ** \n",
    "- MODEL: Am thinking about automating a small robot that wokes for a very big company , that company delever a daliy tasks to the employee in there different postions in the company building that robot is going to delver that task using the very best rout to pass throught , labeling the tasks and the offices by its place from the nearest to the farest would help much :D.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- The cost of the learning process is zero No assumptions about the characteristics of the concepts to learn have to be done Complex concepts can be learned by local approximation using simple procedure .\n",
    "- The model can not be interpreted (there is no description of the learned concepts) It is computationally expensive to ﬁnd the k nearest neighbours when the dataset is very large Performance depends on the number of dimensions that we have (curse of dimensionality) =⇒ Attribute Selection .\n",
    "- As we are talking about a classification problem KNN is is a very good choice, taking in consideration the value of the features of the data set, it can be seen that some values have a heir propaplitly to be with the person that is more likely to donate in other words >> the nearest neighbor to go to first :D .\n",
    "        \n",
    "** 2- Random Forest. **\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Fusion for the Classiﬁcation of UrbanRemote Sensing Images , it is a great project  \n",
    "    ** \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3204218_Decision_Fusion_for_the_Classification_of_Urban_Remote_Sensing_Images\"**\n",
    "- It is one of the most accurate learning algorithms available. For many data sets, it produces a highly accurate classifier,It runs efficiently on large databases,It can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion,It gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification,It generates an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error as the forest building progresses.\n",
    "- Random forests have been observed to overfit for some datasets with noisy classification/regression tasks.\n",
    "    **- \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest#cite_note-6\"**\n",
    "- Since, Random Forest are great on almost any machine learning problem, and will not get overfit like decision tree, I think it would be appropriate along with the fact that our dataset has categorical features       "

    "- Capital gain is a metric that I did not think of it earlier but thinking again, it seems that capital-gain would be a good parameter to predict the amount of money. i think even if two people having the same occupation have different income, they might not donate ,So Capital Gain would be a better metric than occupation\n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
